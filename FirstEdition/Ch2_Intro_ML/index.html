	In this chapter, I will address some of the general machine learning topics. I will use python, numpy, and the Sklearn library to provide example code on how to use 
	the different models and other tools. I will quickly move through logistic regression to arrive at other algorithms. Much of what we learn from using the SKlearn 
	kit can be integrated with PyTorch to make your deep learning code more powerful and modular. That way, you will be able to re-use your code for many different tasks. 
	I will not focus on the theory of machine learning algorithms. There are many books on the theory of machine learning algorithms so instead I will concentrate on the
	practical aspects of using them in Python.

Introduction to Machine Learning
</h1>


<p>

In this chapter, I will address some of the general machine learning topics. I will use python, numpy, and the Sklearn library to provide example code on how to use 
	the different models and other tools. I will quickly move through logistic regression to arrive at other algorithms. Much of what we learn from using the SKlearn

<p>
As you may imagine the SKlearn library is the main library which contains most of the traditional machine learning tools we will discuss in this chapter.
	The numpy library is essential for efficient matrix and linear algebra operations. For those with experience with MatLab, I can say that numpy is a way of 
	performing linear algebra operations in python similar to how they are done in MatLab. This makes the code more efficient in its implementation and faster as well.  
	The datasets library seen above helps to obtain standard corpora. You can use it to obtain annotated data like Fisher’s iris data set, for instance.


From sklearn.cross_validation we can import train_test_split which is used to create splits in a data matrix such as 70 percent for training purposes and 30 percent 
	for testing purposes. From sklearn.preprocessing we can import the StandardScaler module which helps to scale  data. We will use functions such as these to scale 
	our data for the PyTorch based models. Deep learning algorithms can improve significantly when data is properly scaled. So, it is recommended to do this.  
We will use the sklearn.metrics module for performance evaluation of the classifiers. I will show that this module can be used with SKlearn models and with PyTorch models. 
	Again, this will help to more easily understand deep learning since we don’t have to use the more complex and very verbose PyTorch functions. 
<br/>
The main metrics used for classification models are:

	
</p>

<ul>

	<li>
	 accuracy_score	
	</li>
	<li>recall_score</li>
	<li>f1_score</li>
	<li>precision_score</li>
	<li>confusion_matrix</li>
	
	
</ul>

<p>

	The main metrics used for regression models are:

</p>
	

<ul>
<li></li>
	<li>coefficient of determination ($ R^2 $)</li>
	<li>RMSE</li>
	
</ul>
	
<p>
	Two more very important libraries are matplotlib.pyplot and pandas. The matplotlib.pyplot library is very useful for visualization of data and results,
	and the pandas library is very useful for pre-processing. The pandas library can be very useful to pre-process large data sets in very fast and very efficient ways.
There are some parameters that are sometimes useful to set in your code. The code sample below shows the use of np.set\_printoptions. The function is used to print all
	values in a numpy array. This can be useful when trying to visualize the contents of a large data set.

<h1>
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
	
</h1>


<p>

	Before Deep Neural Networks, SVM was one of the most important ML algorithms. SVM is an example of a theoretically well founded machine learning algorithm. And for this 
	reason it has always been very well respected by machine learning practitioners. This is in contrast to neural networks which haven’t always been considered as 
	very strong on their theoretical framework. As an example, in the rest of this chapter I will discuss SVM’s framework and then provide example code to implement an
	SVM with SKlearn. 
Support Vector Machines is a binary classification method based on statistical learning theory which maximizes the margin that separates samples from two classes (Burges 1998;
	Cortes 1995). This supervised learning machine provides the option of evaluating the data under different spaces through Kernels that range from simple linear to 
	Radial Basis Functions [RBF] (\babelEN{\cite{chang2001Ref}}; Burges 1998; Cortes 1995). Additionally, its wide use in the field of machine learning research and 
	ability to handle large feature spaces makes it an attractive tool for many applications. 
Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) methods assume prediction models that can be ascribed a confidence characteristic. They are based on the fact that both structural and 
	empirical risks are minimized. The expected risk can be calculated based on the empirical risk that is present in the data with the associated upper and lower bounds. 



The code for SVM can be seen in the next code listing.

	Summary
</h1>

<p>
In this chapter, an overview of some of the main traditional topics of supervised machine learning was provided.
	In particular, the following machine learning algorithms were presented: logistic regression, KNN, Support Vector Machines, and neural networks. 
	Code examples of their implementation using the SKlearn toolkit or numpy  were presented and discussed. Additionally, issues related to classifier 
	performance were also addressed. The next chapter will focus on issues related to data and data pre-processing that apply to both traditional machine
	learning as well as deep learning.
