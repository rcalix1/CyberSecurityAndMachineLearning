## Hopfield Networks

* We discussed the perceptron. Now it is time to connect multiple neurons together
* we now make the output of one neuron into the input to another neuron
* and this allows us to create neural networks
* Neural Nets can be of 2 types:
* a) Feedforward Nets (all in one direction - directed acyclic graph)
* b) Feedback nets (if notfeedforward, the a network is a feed back net)
* This classification depends on their connectivity
